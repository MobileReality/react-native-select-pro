### Changes

-   Removed `animationDuration` and `animated` props to manage animated select. Instead added `animation` prop which accepts boolean or animation time duration in milliseconds.

-   Select animation was disabled by default, now the select animation is enabled by default.

-   There was multiple styles props (`selectContainerStyle`, etc.), now there is only one style prop `styles` which accepts object of styles.

-   For sections select added support for: `multiple`, `searchable`, `scrollToSelectedOption`

-   When select is `searchable` then focus on opened select.
