## How can I get selected item data?

You should use the [`onSelect`](api/select) callback to get the selected item's data

## `Select` doesn't work inside `Modal` from `react-native`

You need to wrap the code inside the `Modal` in a [`SelectModalProvider`](api/select-modal) to ensure proper functionality.

```typescript jsx
...
<Modal>
    <SelectModalProvider>
        <Select ... />
    </SelectModalProvider>
</Modal>
...
```

## Options list position is not correct

-   If you are using `react-native-modal` and `Modal` is wrapped in `SelectModalProvider` please check if `Modal` [has applied `margin: 0`](https://github.com/react-native-modal/react-native-modal#the-modal-is-not-covering-the-entire-screen)
-   Check if you are using `react-native-safe-area-contex`t and, if so, check if you have used `SafeAreaProvider` in your app's root.
-   If the above points do not resolve the issue, please report it on [GitHub](https://github.com/MobileReality/react-native-select-pro/issues/new/choose).
