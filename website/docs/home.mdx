`react-native-select-pro` is a component for React Native that allows data to be presented as an options list.

The component is based on the great open source library [`react-native-portal`](https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-portal), which allows selected content to be placed in the location where the `PortalProvider` is located, here is a simple example -> https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-portal#simple-portal
